# Extremely Basic Battle Simulator
An extremely basic battle simulator I did for college. It's pretty terrible.

## What the hell is this?
I had to make a game for college. In C++. I was originally gonna reuse my [`playerobject` project](https://github.com/CutieGorlAstrid/playerobject), but that was done in Python, and the requirements asked for C++ in particular, so I had to come up with something on my own.
Based off of my aforementioned project, but fundamentally different, this project was intended to be an RPG game. Since I **really** suck at C++, and considering the deadline, it's now *Extremely Basic Battle Simulator*, obviously ~~ripping off~~ inspired by the title of Landfall Games' *Totally Accurate Battle Simulator*.

## Extremely basic?
Yeah, you heard me. This consists of **one C++ program** that works via command-line. It also uses cross-platform stuff, so you can compile and run it with basically anything that supports C++11.

## Binaries?
I'll work on those when I can. Besides, compiling this is super easy. On Linux and macOS, you should be able to run `g++` from the command line. On Windows, you should probably install [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/). If you just wanna run the code without the hassle of using the command line, you can use a website like [cpp.sh](http://www.cpp.sh/) and paste the [source code](https://github.com/CutieGorlAstrid/ExtremelyBasicBattleSimulator/blob/master/main.cpp) in there. If you can't even do *that*, you can run the code at [repl.it](https://repl.it/@SpeedStriker243/ExtremelyBasicBattleSimulator).
